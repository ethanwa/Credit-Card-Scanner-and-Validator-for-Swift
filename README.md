# Credit Card Scanner and Validator
Requires iOS 13 or above.

Uses the iOS Vision text recognizer framework to visually read credit card numbers and expiration dates. During the recognition process, it uses the Luhn algorithm to make sure the CC number is valid. It also checks agains a list of prefix numbers to determine card type (Mastercard, Visa, Discover, Amex, etc).

This is a very early 0.1 development version.
